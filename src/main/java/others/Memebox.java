/*
A dominant member in the array is one that occupies over half the positions in the array, for example:

{3, 67, 23, 67, 67}

67 is a dominant member because it appears in the array in 3/5 (>50%) positions.

Provide a method that takes in an array and returns an index of the dominant member if one exists and -1 if there is none.
